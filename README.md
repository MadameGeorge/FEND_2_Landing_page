## Description
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

## Instructions

### Mandatory
- The project should have a structure like the one shown below. All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.
- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
- Styling has been added for active states.
- There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
- The ReadMe file should have non-default text in it that is specific to this project. It doesn’t have to be thorough, but should have some basic information, and use correct markdown.
- Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.

### Optional
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
- Add a scroll to top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content.
- Make sections collapsible.
